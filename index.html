	<h2>Who is Kanye West? </h2>
	<p>Kanye West is a hip hop artist and producer born in June 8th, 1977. He is known for his creativity and conceptual albums as well as being influential both within and outside of his genre. I enjoy his music because of the diversity of his music and simply because I find it enjoyable and fun. Even what I rank last is still pretty good, so this list is more like 'Perfect to Okay.'</p>
